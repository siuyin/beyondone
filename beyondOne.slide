NATS and Go working beautifully together
2 May 2022
Summary: What if you could have request/reply, event processing and persistence delivered as one executable binary? And that executable can be built to target all `Go` targets!

```
$ docker run --rm busybox:1.27 sh -c 'ls  /bin'

## What if:
You could have request/reply, event processing and persistence,

And that executable can be built to target all `Go` targets!

## You can, with beyondOne! Let me show you ..

## The process
1. Embed NATS:  
`https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2/server#Server`
1. Write your goroutines.
1. Build:  
`GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build`


## Embedding NATS with a Request / Reply example
.code cmd/request-reply/main.go /func main\(/,/^}/

## Embed the NATS server
.code cmd/request-reply/main.go /func embedNATS\(/,/^}/

## connectSvr
.code cmd/request-reply/main.go /var \(/,/^\)/
.code cmd/request-reply/main.go /func connectSvr\(/,/^}/
.code cmd/request-reply/main.go /func waitForSvrRdy\(/,/^}/

## Let's ping our embedded NATS Server!

Build and start our embedded NATS server:

---


```
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o /tmp/mysvr cmd/request-reply/main.go

/tmp/mysvr
```

Ping the server using the `nats` command line utility:  
Get `natscli` from: `https://github.com/nats-io/natscli/releases`

---

```
nats publish hello world
```

## Let's write a math.sum service
Instead of `http` transport and `json` encoding,  
let's use `nats` transport and `plain text` encoding.

.code cmd/request-reply/main.go /func mathSvcStart\(/,/^\}/

.code cmd/request-reply/main.go /func replyWithSum\(/,/^\}/


## Try it out ..
Start our embedded NATS server:

---


```
go run cmd/request-reply/main.go
```

Make some requests to math.sum:

---

```
nats request math.sum 2,3

nats request math.sum 2,3,4

nats request math.sum 2a,3
```

## A math.sum service requestor
.code cmd/request-reply/main.go /func requestMathSvc\(/,/^\}/

## Exercising the requestor
Start our embedded NATS server:

---


```
go run cmd/request-reply/main.go
```

And type in the values..


## Wait, there is more! Would you like a key-value store for free?

## Get a key-value store for free

First, let's start our embedded NATS server.

`go run cmd/request-request/main.go`

---

```
nats kv --help
```

---

```
nats kv add mykv
nats kv ls

nats kv put mykv a apple
nats kv get mykv a

nats kv put mykv n 123
nats kv get mykv n

nats kv put mykv pi 3.14
nats kv get mykv pi
```

And of course the above operations can be done with `Go` code as well.

## Some programs run fast, others run slower..

## Temporal decoupling with event streaming
Imagine you have a shopping list for a wedding.  
Eg. hire photographer, book restaurant ... etc.

Producing the list takes a relatively short amount of time.

Doing, executing, the items on that list takes a much longer time.

Say you ask a computer program to run the wedding preparations:  
What happens if that program was interrupted?

Would it start again from the beginning?  
What would it take for it to remember its place?

## The wedding preparations list..
.code cmd/evstream/main.go /var lst/,/^}/

## Event Stream initialisation
.code cmd/evstream/main.go /func main\(/,/^}/
.code cmd/evstream/main.go /func defineEventStream\(/,/^}/

## Don't initialise every time the program is run
.code cmd/evstream/main.go /func initStream\(/,/^}/

## Here is how you add a stream
.code cmd/evstream/main.go /func addStream\(/,/^}/

And seed the stream with events..

.code cmd/evstream/main.go /func feedEvents\(/,/^}/

## Let's inspect our event stream.

First run our beyondOne application:  
`go run cmd/evstream/*.go`


Now lets see if we have any streams defined:  
`nats stream list`

---

Now let's seed the event stream..  
`go run cmd/evstream/*.go start`

`nats stream view wedding 3`

---

`nats stream rm wedding`
