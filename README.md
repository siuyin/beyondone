# beyond One
beyond One is a new way of delivery computing capabilities.

What if you could have request/reply, event processing and persistence delivered as one executable binary?  
And that executable can be built for all `Go` targets!
```
$ go version
go version go1.18.1 linux/amd64

$ go tool dist list

aix/ppc64
android/386
android/amd64
android/arm
android/arm64

# Write up
I wrote a presentation illustrating my ideas.

Run:
```
present -http :3999 -orighost localhost
```

then point your browser to `localhost:3999` and click on the `slide` link.
